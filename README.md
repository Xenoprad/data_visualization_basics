🎨 Data Visualization Basics with Matplotlib

Hi there! 👋
This is a small project where I’m learning and practicing how to create different kinds of plots using **Python** and **Matplotlib** inside Jupyter Notebook.

I’ve kept it simple — just exploring basic plots like line charts and bar graphs using some practice data (some of which I created with the help of ChatGPT for learning purposes).


📂 What's in this repo?

| Notebook | What it shows |
|----------|----------------|
| `line_plot_visualization.ipynb` | A basic line plot to show how data trends look over time or categories. |
| `bar_plot_visualization.ipynb` | A bar chart that shows expression levels in different human tissues. (Note: This is not real experimental data — just practice values.) |



💡 Why I made this

I’m just getting started with data visualization, especially for bioinformatics. I wanted to understand how to:
- Create plots from scratch using Matplotlib
- Customize labels, titles, and colors
- Work inside Jupyter Notebook and keep my code organized



🧬 About the Data

The data used in the bar chart (tissue expression levels) is not real — it's just made-up values to help me understand how plotting works. I don’t claim it’s scientifically accurate — this is just for learning!

If you're also learning Python, Matplotlib, or bioinformatics stuff, feel free to check out this repo and reach out!
I'm open to feedback, suggestions, and even small collaborations.
